# Tween Animation Exercise

By adding an imageview to my project, I animated it using alpha, scale, translate, rotate properties.
## What does this project do?
> First I added an android imageview.Then, the specified features were used respectively.
>>Rotate Feature: This feature enabled the imageview I added to rotate around itself with the angle I specified.

>>Alpha Feature: With this feature, the visual I added will fade from the screen for a certain period of time and then come back.

>>Scale Feature: This feature allows the image to be resized. First it gets smaller, then it starts to get closer to the screen.

>>Translate Feature: Thanks to this, our image can move vertically or horizontally.

I have made an animation that uses the features we added by pressing the button.
