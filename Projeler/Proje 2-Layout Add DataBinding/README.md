# LAYOUT DataBinding Exercise

I added databindig to Layout Design, the first project I made in my Upschool process. 
## What does this project do?
> This project has 2 layouts that'll only function as pages.
> These are specified as start activity and main activity. Switched between these specified pages.
> Help was taken from https://www.figma.com/ while designing and laying out the page.
> These layouts are designed for an android application.
